# kd-scripts
All scripts I have been working on in my internship

1. Preprocessing scripts & folder structure
PDT_preprocess.m
kd_foldstruct

2. kdk_comp_R_P : compares gain, loss & ed after "preprocessing" in R with P structure (MATLAB)

3. Physio correction
kd_physio_batch: function for physio correction PDT
kd_physio_pipeline: maybe include in PDT pipeline?

4. Single Subject Models
... edfix03: working, but contrast manager/collinearity
... 0115: need to review this script and add acc_rej
... tworuns_acc: working, but contrast manager/collinearity
... tworuns_new: no acc_rej yet. Work on that again?
